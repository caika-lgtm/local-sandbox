# Windows Future Work

This file tracks post-MVP Windows work that should not be rediscovered from the
deleted sprint workspace.

## Release readiness

- Record the final `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke` run and diagnostics artifact
  IDs in PR or release evidence for branches that touch Windows runtime
  behavior.
- Decide and document the support policy for user-supplied QEMU overrides.
- Evaluate signing, SBOM, or mirroring improvements for the managed QEMU
  artifact.
- Expand the current `lsb doctor windows-smb-policy` command into a broader
  Windows diagnostics namespace if more host checks need one entrypoint.
- Decide whether to keep default self-hosted labels or add a dedicated WHPX
  runner label before growing the runner pool.

## Runtime capabilities

- Add Windows interactive shell/PTY support over the session mux if product
  demand justifies the terminal work.
- Decide whether port forwarding should migrate to the mux or otherwise support
  concurrent forwarding sessions without the current serialization.
- Design a hybrid watch aggregator before supporting one recursive watch whose
  root spans both guest-only paths and direct SMB mount targets.
- Define any explicit resync API or event for direct SMB watcher overflow if
  callers need more than the current surfaced error.
- Add live checkpointing only after a QMP/block-layer design is accepted.
- Add native Windows build-number probing through Windows API, registry query,
  or the future diagnostics command.

## Storage

- Decide whether to migrate Windows checkpoints from flattened qcow2 artifacts
  to CAS/NBD, persistent qcow2 overlay chains, or another deduplicated format.
- Validate data-dir move/delete behavior for any backing-chain design.
- Keep product checkpoint semantics explicit; do not replace them with QEMU
  internal snapshots.

## Filesystem sharing experiments

### SMB/CIFS direct mount follow-ups

SMB/CIFS is the implemented Windows direct directory mount path under D024.
Future work should focus on hardening and follow-up validation, not replacing
the approved path without a new accepted decision.

Preserve these constraints:

- CLI no-suffix and CLI `:ro` mounts remain overlay snapshot imports.
- CLI `:rw` plus `--allow-host-writes` is SMB/CIFS direct read-write and
  requires an elevated Administrator shell.
- SDK and Node direct mounts use the existing public API shape.
- SMB direct mounts use LocalSandbox-controlled proxy networking and must not
  imply arbitrary outbound `allow_net`.
- Host resources are ephemeral and must be cleaned up: local user, SMB shares,
  generated credentials, NTFS/share ACL grants, and stale cleanup manifests.
- Direct SMB watch is implemented for paths at or below one direct SMB target.
  Continue hardening overflow behavior, high-churn workloads, large trees,
  source deletion, and cleanup ordering.
- Keep `lsb doctor windows-smb-policy` focused on read-only diagnosis by
  default, with machine-policy changes only behind explicit `--fix`.
- Expand performance and large-tree validation after functional WHPX smoke
  evidence is current.

### VirtioFS on Windows

Question: can QEMU on Windows provide a production-suitable VirtioFS path with
acceptable packaging, performance, security, and file semantics?

Validate:

- required `virtiofsd` binary and Windows support status,
- read-only Windows directory exposure into Linux guest,
- case sensitivity, symlinks/junctions, permissions, file watching, large
  directories, and concurrent behavior,
- guest overlay behavior preserving LocalSandbox semantics,
- no admin requirement for normal use.

If it fails, keep snapshot import/export and consider custom sync.

### 9p/virtfs on Windows

Question: can QEMU 9p/virtfs provide a simpler live sharing path than VirtioFS?

Validate read-only behavior, metadata fidelity, large-tree performance,
symlink/junction behavior, and path escape resistance.

## Transport experiments

### QEMU virtio-vsock on Windows host

Question: can QEMU on Windows WHPX provide a reliable host-side virtio-vsock
endpoint compatible with LocalSandbox's existing `lsb-proto` transport?

Validate:

- Linux guest sees the vsock device,
- Windows host can open a guest vsock connection without TCP host networking,
- framed ping/ready exchange works repeatedly,
- security properties match or exceed the virtio-serial MVP.

Keep virtio-serial as supported transport unless evidence justifies a new
accepted decision.

### Hyper-V sockets

Potential future transport only if virtio-serial proves inadequate. This likely
requires additional Windows-specific registration and guest kernel work.

## Networking/security

- Evaluate Windows Firewall only as defense-in-depth, not the primary policy
  mechanism.
- Continue testing direct-IP, forged Host/SNI, missing-domain, and secret
  redaction paths as proxy code evolves.
- Continue hardening managed QEMU provenance, release validation, and override
  path trust.

## Platform expansion

### Windows ARM64

Windows ARM64 is planned but out of MVP.

Validate:

- QEMU binary and WHPX ARM64 requirements,
- guest architecture strategy,
- asset build and packaging path,
- Node package target naming,
- no disruption to Windows x64 backend.
