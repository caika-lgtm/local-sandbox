# Windows Port Diagnostics Guide

Use this guide to keep errors actionable and repeatable.

## General diagnostic principles

- Prefer structured errors over raw strings.
- Include remediation steps in user-facing diagnostics.
- Always capture redacted QEMU argv for QEMU start/boot failures.
- Always capture serial logs for boot/guest-agent failures.
- Never log secrets, proxy substitution values, or full unredacted environment.
- Preserve temporary artifacts when a debug flag is set.

## Failure matrix

| Symptom | Likely causes | Evidence to capture | Recommended checks |
|---|---|---|---|
| QEMU not found | Not installed, not on PATH, `LSB_QEMU` wrong, unsupported arch binary | configured path, PATH lookup summary, error kind | `where qemu-system-x86_64`, `qemu-system-x86_64 --version` |
| WHPX unavailable | Windows feature disabled, virtualization disabled in firmware, running inside unsupported nested VM, non-Windows-11 host | preflight result, QEMU stderr, Windows version | `optionalfeatures.exe`, Windows Features, BIOS virtualization, runner labels |
| QEMU starts then exits | bad argv, missing assets, unsupported device, invalid path quoting | redacted argv, stderr, exit code | run redacted argv manually from temp dir |
| Kernel does not boot | wrong kernel arch, missing `console`, WHPX/device issue, bad initrd | serial log, QEMU stderr, asset hashes | minimal boot command from Appendix A of RFC |
| Rootfs not mounted | wrong virtio-blk device, missing ext4 support, wrong root arg, corrupted disk | serial log, guest panic/initramfs output | confirm `root=/dev/vda` or final chosen arg |
| Guest agent not started | initramfs issue, missing binary, guest panic, transport wait race | serial log, init output, ready timeout | boot with verbose console and preserve artifacts |
| Control pipe unavailable | named pipe race, bad QEMU chardev, guest driver missing, permissions | pipe path, QEMU argv, guest logs | test host pipe open before/after boot; fake transport tests |
| Exec hangs | protocol framing bug, guest process wait bug, stdout/stderr backpressure, timeout missing | protocol trace with redaction, guest logs | small command, large stdout command, timeout test |
| Copy-in fails | Windows path normalization, symlink/junction policy, ACL denial, guest dir missing | source/target paths redacted as needed, error kind | path traversal tests, symlink policy tests |
| Port forwarding fails | listener conflict, control channel unavailable, guest service not listening, NAT accidentally required | host listener log, forward request/response, guest logs | confirm no NIC required, bind only loopback |
| Network policy bypass | QEMU user networking accidentally enabled, proxy bypass, DNS/direct IP hole, UDP path open | redacted network config, QEMU argv, proxy logs | no-network default test, direct IP denial test |
| Checkpoint restore fails | base/writable mismatch, path locking, copy failure, disk image corruption | checkpoint metadata, disk paths, QEMU stderr | restore immediately after create, verify base immutability |

## Suggested `lsb doctor windows` output

M02 should introduce or prepare a diagnostic path that can eventually print:

```text
LocalSandbox Windows diagnostics
Host: Windows 11 x86_64 build <redacted-or-normal>
QEMU: found at C:\...\qemu-system-x86_64.exe
QEMU version: <version>
WHPX: available
Assets: kernel ok, initramfs ok, rootfs ok
Default network: disabled
Control transport: virtio-serial named pipe supported by configured QEMU
Result: ready
```

Failures should name the first blocking condition and include next steps.

## Debug artifact directory

Use a per-run directory, for example:

```text
<local-sandbox-data>\debug\windows-qemu\<timestamp>-<sandbox-id>\
  qemu.argv.redacted.txt
  qemu.stderr.log
  qemu.stdout.log
  serial.log
  qmp.log
  host.log
  guest-protocol.log.redacted
  preflight.json
```

The exact location may change, but it must use Windows-safe paths and owner-only access where possible.
