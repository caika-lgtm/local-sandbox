## Current known blockers

- Windows VM startup remains a stub; QEMU process lifecycle, guest boot, transport, networking, mounts, and checkpoints are not implemented.
- M02 safe WHPX preflight does not launch a VM. It proves the selected QEMU binary reports WHPX in `-accel help`, but firmware/Windows Hypervisor Platform runtime readiness is finally proven by later boot smoke tests.
- Full `cargo check --workspace --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` from this macOS host is blocked by external Windows C/assembler tooling for transitive crates (`ring` needs Windows/MSVC headers such as `assert.h`; `blake3` needs `ml64.exe`). The changed `lsb-platform` crate passes a targeted Windows compile check; run the full workspace check on a Windows/MSVC runner.
- The current safe host probe verifies target OS/arch and can report a supplied Windows major version. The standard host implementation does not yet query the native Windows build number without adding Windows API or registry probing.

## Recently completed work

- 2026-07-03: Completed M01 compile scaffolding. Added `lsb-platform::windows_x86_64` backend/config/error stubs, removed the `lsb-vm` non-macOS compile rejection, added Windows runtime capability errors, cfg-gated Unix-only proxy/store/CLI paths, and added stub coverage tests.
- 2026-07-03: Ran Windows hardware workflow through `./scripts/win-gh-test`. `check` passed on run `28651692448`. Initial `unit` run `28651764230` failed because Windows-only stub tests used `expect_err` with non-`Debug` handle types; fixed in `066a6c2`, then `unit` passed on run `28651905208`.
- 2026-07-03: Added macOS helper for manually dispatching Windows hardware workflow, added Windows smoke/e2e script entrypoints, and documented runner trigger usage.
- 2026-07-03: Started M02 on `codex/windows-m02-qemu-discovery-preflight` from `958562e`; scope is QEMU discovery, version probing, WHPX preflight diagnostics, and fake-runner unit tests only.
- 2026-07-03: Completed M02 QEMU discovery/preflight scaffolding under `lsb-platform::windows_x86_64::qemu`. Added env/config/PATH discovery, `--version` parsing, `--help` suitability checks, WHPX `-accel help` inspection, structured actionable errors, and fake host/runner unit tests. No VM boot, argv builder, QEMU process lifecycle, or TCG fallback was implemented.
- 2026-07-03: Ran Windows hardware workflow through `./scripts/win-gh-test`. `check` passed on run `28653449586`; `unit` passed on run `28653507512`.
- 2026-07-03: Started M03 on `codex/windows-m03-qemu-argv-builder` from `1d0a3c8`; scope is typed deterministic QEMU argv construction only, with no QEMU spawn, process lifecycle, boot, virtio-serial connection, networking, mounts, or checkpoint implementation.
- 2026-07-03: Completed M03 QEMU argv builder. Added typed QEMU boot/machine/disk/kernel/serial/control/QMP config and `QemuArgvBuilder` under `lsb-platform::windows_x86_64::qemu`. Generated argv uses WHPX-only `q35,accel=whpx`, direct Linux boot, virtio-blk root disk, serial output, optional virtio-serial control pipe placeholder, optional private QMP pipe, and explicit `-nic none`. Added sanitized command diagnostics that redact executable, asset paths, serial log path, control pipe name, and QMP pipe name. No QEMU process is started.

## Active implementation notes

- 2026-07-03: M01 started on `codex/windows-m01-compile-stubs` from `3501c2b`; scope is compile scaffolding only, with no QEMU discovery/startup or runtime feature implementation.
- 2026-07-03: M01 placed Windows x86_64 scaffolding under `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/{backend.rs,config.rs,errors.rs}`. The stub VM can be constructed but `start`, `stop`, and guest control transport return explicit unsupported errors.
- 2026-07-03: Windows proxy networking (`M12`), NBD/CAS storage transport (`M13`), port forwarding (`M11`), shell/exec control transport (`M06`/`M08`), and prune process-liveness checks fail closed instead of opening listeners/devices or guessing behavior.
- 2026-07-03: M02 introduced private QEMU modules at `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/{discovery.rs,version.rs,preflight.rs}`. The module has a scoped `dead_code` allowance because M02 prepares the reusable preflight API before M04 wires VM startup/process lifecycle.
- 2026-07-03: Real QEMU preflight hook is `windows_x86_64::qemu::tests::real_qemu_preflight_when_explicitly_enabled`; run it only with `LSB_TEST_REAL_QEMU=1` and `LSB_QEMU` pointing at `qemu-system-x86_64.exe`.
- 2026-07-03: M03 added `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/{config.rs,argv.rs}`. The builder returns a program `PathBuf` plus `Vec<OsString>` argv and a separate redacted diagnostic display. Paths with spaces are preserved as single argv entries; root disk paths embedded in QEMU option syntax escape commas by doubling them. QMP is represented only as a named pipe endpoint and remains QEMU-management-only.
- 2026-07-03: Started M04 on `codex/windows-m04-qemu-lifecycle` from `f0413a9`; scope is QEMU process lifecycle, deterministic artifacts, fake-process tests, and Windows Job Object cleanup only. M04 must not implement guest boot, guest readiness, virtio-serial transport, networking, mounts, checkpoints, or Node packaging.

## Open follow-ups

- [x] Confirm final location of Windows backend module under `lsb-platform`.
- [ ] Run full `cargo check --workspace --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` on a Windows/MSVC runner.
- [ ] Wire M02 `QemuPreflight` into the future Windows diagnostic/start path without booting a VM before M04/M05.
- [ ] Wire M03 `QemuArgvBuilder` into M04 process lifecycle without changing public CLI/SDK/Node APIs or claiming boot support.
- [ ] Persist a redacted `qemu.argv.json` or equivalent diagnostics artifact once M04 creates per-instance diagnostics directories.
- [ ] Decide exact hidden/debug flag name for TCG once CLI command parsing is inspected.
- [ ] Decide exact QEMU minimum version after M02 preflight experimentation.
- [ ] Decide whether native Windows build-number probing should use a Windows API, registry query, or remain deferred until a CLI diagnostics command exists.
- [ ] Confirm whether the self-hosted runner should keep default `self-hosted, Windows, X64` labels or add custom `whpx` / `local-sandbox` labels.
