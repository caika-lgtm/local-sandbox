## Current known blockers

- Windows VM startup now attempts M05 direct Linux boot only: it runs QEMU discovery/preflight, builds WHPX direct-boot argv, launches through the existing QEMU supervisor, captures serial/stdout/stderr/preflight/status artifacts, and returns success only after QEMU remains alive through the boot observation window. Guest readiness, control transport, exec, networking, mounts, checkpoints, and Node packaging remain unsupported.
- Guest readiness, control transport, exec, networking, mounts, checkpoints, and Node packaging remain unsupported after M05. M05 only proves the Windows backend can launch the existing assets through QEMU + WHPX and keep QEMU alive through the boot observation window while capturing logs.
- Full `cargo check --workspace --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` from this macOS host is blocked by external Windows C/assembler tooling for transitive crates (`ring` needs Windows/MSVC headers such as `assert.h`; `blake3` needs `ml64.exe`). The changed `lsb-platform` crate passes a targeted Windows compile check; run the full workspace check on a Windows/MSVC runner.
- The current safe host probe verifies target OS/arch and can report a supplied Windows major version. The standard host implementation does not yet query the native Windows build number without adding Windows API or registry probing.

## Recently completed work

- 2026-07-03: Completed M01 compile scaffolding. Added `lsb-platform::windows_x86_64` backend/config/error stubs, removed the `lsb-vm` non-macOS compile rejection, added Windows runtime capability errors, cfg-gated Unix-only proxy/store/CLI paths, and added stub coverage tests.
- 2026-07-03: Ran Windows hardware workflow through `./scripts/win-gh-test`. `check` passed on run `28651692448`. Initial `unit` run `28651764230` failed because Windows-only stub tests used `expect_err` with non-`Debug` handle types; fixed in `066a6c2`, then `unit` passed on run `28651905208`.
- 2026-07-03: Added macOS helper for manually dispatching Windows hardware workflow, added Windows smoke/e2e script entrypoints, and documented runner trigger usage.
- 2026-07-03: Started M02 on `codex/windows-m02-qemu-discovery-preflight` from `958562e`; scope is QEMU discovery, version probing, WHPX preflight diagnostics, and fake-runner unit tests only.
- 2026-07-03: Completed M02 QEMU discovery/preflight scaffolding under `lsb-platform::windows_x86_64::qemu`. Added env/config/PATH discovery, `--version` parsing, `--help` suitability checks, WHPX `-accel help` inspection, structured actionable errors, and fake host/runner unit tests. No VM boot, argv builder, QEMU process lifecycle, or TCG fallback was implemented.
- 2026-07-03: Ran Windows hardware workflow through `./scripts/win-gh-test`. `check` passed on run `28653449586`; `unit` passed on run `28653507512`.
- 2026-07-03: Started M03 on `codex/windows-m03-qemu-argv-builder` from `1d0a3c8`; scope is typed deterministic QEMU argv construction only, with no QEMU spawn, process lifecycle, boot, virtio-serial connection, networking, mounts, or checkpoint implementation.
- 2026-07-03: Completed M03 QEMU argv builder. Added typed QEMU boot/machine/disk/kernel/serial/control/QMP config and `QemuArgvBuilder` under `lsb-platform::windows_x86_64::qemu`. Generated argv uses WHPX-only `q35,accel=whpx`, direct Linux boot, virtio-blk root disk, serial output, optional virtio-serial control pipe placeholder, optional private QMP pipe, and explicit `-nic none`. Added sanitized command diagnostics that redact executable, asset paths, serial log path, control pipe name, and QMP pipe name. No QEMU process is started.
- 2026-07-03: Completed M04 QEMU process lifecycle scaffolding. Added private `QemuSupervisor` / `QemuProcess`-style functionality in `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/process.rs`: absolute executable and working-directory validation, safe argv-based spawning without shell invocation, stdout/stderr log redirection, redacted argv and lifecycle status artifacts, structured lifecycle states/errors, startup early-exit detection, wait timeout handling, idempotent terminate/kill/drop cleanup, and Windows Job Object cleanup with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`. Added fake-process tests for startup, timeout, termination, artifacts, redaction, WHPX-like early exit, invalid argv, and a Windows-only Job Object child-tree cleanup test. No guest boot, guest readiness, virtio-serial connection, QMP protocol behavior, networking, mounts, checkpoints, or Node packaging was implemented.
- 2026-07-03: Applied M04 review hardening: post-spawn startup failures now fail closed by terminating containment/direct child fallback and waiting best-effort, spawn failures refresh the lifecycle status artifact to `failed`, default QEMU process environment no longer inherits parent secrets, and fake-process regressions cover these cases.
- 2026-07-03: Applied M04 follow-up review fixes: `QemuSupervisor` is now single-use and rejects restart after `failed`, `exited`, or `terminated` states to avoid stale pid/exit-status diagnostics. M04 forced cleanup remains intentional; graceful QEMU shutdown via private QMP/control plumbing is deferred to M05/MQMP work and documented in the milestone handoff.
- 2026-07-03: Implemented M05 direct boot review slice. Added raw-rootfs direct boot argv config, `qemu::boot` orchestration, deterministic `<instance-dir>/diagnostics` artifact layout, boot observation status/error reporting, ignored `windows_qemu_boot_smoke`, Windows backend `start`/`stop` wiring, and smoke-script hooks for real QEMU preflight plus conditional direct boot.
- 2026-07-04: Implemented manual hardware workflow boot asset provisioning for smoke/e2e. Added Linux `prepare-boot-assets` job with exact source-derived cache, same-run boot asset artifact, Windows persistent cache hydration under `C:\lsb-assets\by-key\<asset-key>\`, disposable per-run rootfs copy, and runner/validation documentation.
- 2026-07-04: Optimized smoke/e2e boot asset reuse for the single persistent Windows runner. The workflow now probes `C:\lsb-assets\by-key\<asset-key>\` first and skips the Linux prepare/upload plus Windows artifact download on a validated local hit; misses still hydrate the local cache from the Linux same-run artifact.
- 2026-07-04: Fixed the first provisioned M05 smoke failure by changing the WHPX direct boot CPU model from `max` to `Westmere`, based on QEMU stderr APX/MPX conflicts and `WHPX: Unexpected VP exit code 4` in run `28696602575`. Also staged external Windows diagnostics into `target/windows-lsb-diagnostics` before artifact upload.

## Active implementation notes

- 2026-07-04: Started M06 on `codex/windows-m06-virtio-serial-control`; scope is the Windows virtio-serial host endpoint, QEMU control chardev wiring, a platform-neutral host control stream abstraction, guest virtio-serial port discovery/opening, and focused tests/docs. Guest ready handshake, exec/file API parity, muxing, mounts, networking, checkpoints, and Node packaging remain later milestones unless already supported by existing code paths.
- 2026-07-03: M01 started on `codex/windows-m01-compile-stubs` from `3501c2b`; scope is compile scaffolding only, with no QEMU discovery/startup or runtime feature implementation.
- 2026-07-03: M01 placed Windows x86_64 scaffolding under `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/{backend.rs,config.rs,errors.rs}`. The stub VM can be constructed but `start`, `stop`, and guest control transport return explicit unsupported errors.
- 2026-07-03: Windows proxy networking (`M12`), NBD/CAS storage transport (`M13`), port forwarding (`M11`), shell/exec control transport (`M06`/`M08`), and prune process-liveness checks fail closed instead of opening listeners/devices or guessing behavior.
- 2026-07-03: M02 introduced private QEMU modules at `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/{discovery.rs,version.rs,preflight.rs}`. The module has a scoped `dead_code` allowance because M02 prepares the reusable preflight API before M04 wires VM startup/process lifecycle.
- 2026-07-03: Real QEMU preflight hook is `windows_x86_64::qemu::tests::real_qemu_preflight_when_explicitly_enabled`; run it only with `LSB_TEST_REAL_QEMU=1` and `LSB_QEMU` pointing at `qemu-system-x86_64.exe`.
- 2026-07-03: M03 added `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/{config.rs,argv.rs}`. The builder returns a program `PathBuf` plus `Vec<OsString>` argv and a separate redacted diagnostic display. Paths with spaces are preserved as single argv entries; root disk paths embedded in QEMU option syntax escape commas by doubling them. QMP is represented only as a named pipe endpoint and remains QEMU-management-only.
- 2026-07-03: Started M04 on `codex/windows-m04-qemu-lifecycle` from `f0413a9`; scope is QEMU process lifecycle, deterministic artifacts, fake-process tests, and Windows Job Object cleanup only. M04 must not implement guest boot, guest readiness, virtio-serial transport, networking, mounts, checkpoints, or Node packaging.
- 2026-07-03: M04 keeps the public Windows backend returning capability errors from `Sandbox.start()` / VM startup. The supervisor is intentionally private and ready for M05 to use once direct Linux boot and per-instance disk/artifact preparation are added.
- 2026-07-03: If Windows Job Object assignment fails because the child process is already in a parent job, the supervisor fails closed with `ProcessAlreadyInJob`, kills the just-spawned child, and records a precise remediation. This protects cleanup semantics on restrictive CI runners but may require runner job configuration changes.
- 2026-07-03: M04 `terminate()`, `kill()`, and `Drop` perform forced cleanup only. M05/MQMP should add private graceful QEMU shutdown before disk/checkpoint work depends on clean QEMU exit.
- 2026-07-03: M04 still assigns QEMU to the cleanup Job Object immediately after `Command::spawn`. Before public boot integration, evaluate create-in-job or suspended-create/resume if QEMU is observed to spawn helper processes before Job Object assignment.
- 2026-07-03: QEMU executable validation still checks existence and file-ness only. Add provenance/ACL diagnostics under existing risk R008 before public Windows runtime support.
- 2026-07-03: Started M05 on `codex/windows-m05-direct-linux-boot-serial-logs` from `2023e10`; scope is direct Linux boot, serial/QEMU log artifacts, boot observation timeout, and Windows backend lifecycle wiring only. Guest control, readiness handshake, exec, mounts, networking, checkpoints, and Node packaging remain out of scope.
- 2026-07-03: M05 uses the existing prepared per-instance raw `rootfs.ext4` work image as the writable virtio block device (`format=raw`). This matches current CLI/SDK preparation and the milestone smoke path. qcow2 overlays remain the later checkpoint/store direction and were not introduced in M05.
- 2026-07-03: M05 success is intentionally limited to `qemu_process_alive_after_boot_observation_window_with_serial_output`, recorded in `boot.status.json`. It proves QEMU stayed alive through the observation window and that Linux serial output was captured, but it does not implement LocalSandbox guest control or a guest-ready handshake; M06/M07 must add virtio-serial control and readiness.
- 2026-07-03: M05 artifacts are written under `<instance-dir>/diagnostics`: `qemu.argv.redacted.txt`, `qemu.stdout.log`, `qemu.stderr.log`, `qemu.status.json`, `serial.log`, `preflight.json`, and `boot.status.json`. The ignored boot smoke can override this with `LSB_WINDOWS_BOOT_ARTIFACT_DIR`.
- 2026-07-04: M05 Windows QEMU argv now uses `-cpu Westmere` for WHPX direct boot. `-cpu max` failed on the self-hosted runner before guest serial output; see decision D020.
- 2026-07-04: The hardware workflow copies `C:\lsb-assets\work\<run-id>-<attempt>\diagnostics\*` into `target/windows-lsb-diagnostics/lsb-assets-work/<run-id>-<attempt>\` before uploading `windows-lsb-diagnostics`, because `actions/upload-artifact` rejects source files outside the workspace when mixed with workspace-relative paths.
- 2026-07-04: Review follow-up enabled `CONFIG_SERIAL_8250` and `CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE` for the x86_64 kernel and made empty `serial.log` a `serial_output_missing` boot failure. Green smoke run `28698120131` produced `boot.status.json` with `serial_observed_alive`; `serial.log` contained kernel, `/init`, `EXT4-fs (vda)`, and `lsb-guest` startup lines.
- 2026-07-04: The smoke/e2e boot asset workflow assumes the default Windows labels resolve to exactly one persistent runner. If another runner is added under the same labels, pin the workflow to a dedicated label or remove the local-cache skip path.

The generated key used the `boot-assets-v2-windows-x86_64-*` namespace with the concrete local value `boot-assets-v2-windows-x86_64-8de6e39d20c26f35e16a94ad50cf7e12ed4d95ae`. `pwsh`, `powershell`, and `actionlint` were not installed locally, so PowerShell syntax and GitHub Actions semantic linting still need runner/CI validation. |
| 2026-07-04 | M05/M15 | Windows self-hosted | `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke` | Pass | Run `28698120131`, Windows job `85112023054`, commit `ccf7cbf`. Provisioned assets were used, QEMU 11.0.50 ran real preflight, and `windows_qemu_boot_smoke` observed QEMU alive for 10000 ms with non-empty serial output. Logs were written under `C:\lsb-assets\work\28698120131-1\diagnostics` and uploaded in artifact `windows-lsb-diagnostics` ID `8079375534`; `serial.log` was 15762 bytes and contained `Linux version`, `Kernel command line`, `Run /init`, `EXT4-fs (vda)`, and `lsb-guest` startup lines. `boot.status.json` recorded `serial_observed_alive` and `qemu_process_alive_after_boot_observation_window_with_serial_output`. |

Full workspace tests passed with 98 tests passed and 2 ignored real-QEMU hooks. |
| 2026-07-04 | M05/M15 | Windows self-hosted | `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke` | Pass / superseded | Run `28697374629`, Windows job `85109378078`, commit `a21f97c`. Provisioned assets were used, QEMU 11.0.50 ran real preflight, and `windows_qemu_boot_smoke` observed QEMU alive for 10000 ms. Logs were written under `C:\lsb-assets\work\28697374629-1\diagnostics` and uploaded in artifact `windows-lsb-diagnostics` ID `8079059489`; `serial.log` existed but was empty, so this evidence was superseded by the stricter serial-output requirement in `ccf7cbf`. |
| 2026-07-04 | M05/M15 | Windows self-hosted | Provisioned smoke run from user | Fail | Run `28696602575`, job `85108027605`, commit `fa6158d`. Boot assets were provisioned correctly, but `windows_qemu_boot_smoke` failed because QEMU exited before the observation window with APX/MPX warnings and `WHPX: Unexpected VP exit code 4`; serial output was empty. The diagnostics upload step also failed because it tried to upload `C:\lsb-assets\work\*\diagnostics\*` directly outside the workspace. Fixed in `a21f97c`. |

## Open follow-ups

- [x] Confirm final location of Windows backend module under `lsb-platform`.
- [ ] Run full `cargo check --workspace --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` on a Windows/MSVC runner.
- [x] Wire M02 `QemuPreflight` into the future Windows diagnostic/start path without booting a VM before M04/M05.
- [x] Wire M03 `QemuArgvBuilder` into M04 process lifecycle without changing public CLI/SDK/Node APIs or claiming boot support.
- [x] Persist a redacted `qemu.argv.json` or equivalent diagnostics artifact once M04 creates per-instance diagnostics directories.
- [x] Wire private M04 `QemuSupervisor` into the Windows backend start path during M05 without claiming readiness before the direct boot smoke path exists.
- [x] Use M05 per-instance artifact layout to decide whether `qemu.argv.redacted.txt` should become structured JSON or remain a redacted text command display.
- [x] Manually dispatch `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke` and confirm the workflow-provisioned disposable boot assets run `windows_qemu_boot_smoke` instead of skipping.
- [ ] Decide exact hidden/debug flag name for TCG once CLI command parsing is inspected.
- [ ] Decide exact QEMU minimum version after M02 preflight experimentation.
- [ ] Decide whether native Windows build-number probing should use a Windows API, registry query, or remain deferred until a CLI diagnostics command exists.
- [ ] Confirm whether the self-hosted runner should keep default `self-hosted, Windows, X64` labels or add custom `whpx` / `local-sandbox` labels.
