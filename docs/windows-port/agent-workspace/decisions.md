# Windows Port Decisions

This file records accepted decisions for the Windows QEMU + WHPX port. Agents must treat these as fixed unless implementation is blocked. New decisions must be appended as decision records; do not edit history except for typo fixes.

## Decision change process

A decision may be changed only when all are true:

1. The current milestone is blocked without the change.
2. The agent records the evidence and failed alternatives.
3. The change is reviewed by the maintainer.
4. The RFC is updated if the change affects architecture or user-visible behavior.

Use `templates/decision-record.md` for new decisions.

## Accepted decisions

### D001: MVP host is Windows 11 x86_64

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: The MVP targets Windows 11 on x86_64 hosts.
- Consequence: Do not spend MVP effort on Windows 10, Windows Server, or compatibility shims unless needed for a compile/test path.

### D002: Windows ARM64 is planned, not MVP

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Implement x86_64 first. Keep architecture boundaries clean enough that Windows ARM64 can be added later.
- Consequence: Do not add ARM64-specific QEMU/WHPX work to MVP milestones.

### D003: Guest/kernel/initramfs changes are allowed

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: The Windows port may modify the Linux guest agent, initramfs, and kernel config when needed.
- Consequence: Prefer preserving `lsb-proto` and product semantics over preserving an unchanged guest binary.

### D004: QEMU is discovered for MVP

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: MVP discovers an installed `qemu-system-x86_64.exe` through explicit configuration/env/PATH. Bundling may be considered after the backend is stable.
- Consequence: M02 must produce strong preflight diagnostics.

### D005: Production requires WHPX

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Production Windows runs use `-accel whpx` only.
- Consequence: TCG fallback may exist only as a hidden/debug diagnostic path. Normal CLI/API paths must fail if WHPX is unavailable.

### D006: MVP is QEMU + WHPX only

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: HCS, Hyper-V Manager VMs, WSL2, Docker, and raw WHP VMM implementations are out of MVP scope.
- Consequence: Alternative backend work belongs in later RFCs or experiments, not implementation milestones.

### D007: MVP control transport is virtio-serial

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Use virtio-serial over a private Windows named pipe/QEMU chardev for LocalSandbox control messages. Preserve the existing `lsb-proto` framing and semantics.
- Consequence: QMP is for QEMU management only. QGA is not the LocalSandbox guest API. Vsock/Hyper-V sockets are future validation experiments.

### D008: Public CLI/SDK/Node APIs remain stable

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Preserve public API shape and semantics. Unsupported Windows MVP features should return precise capability errors.
- Consequence: Do not introduce Windows-only public APIs unless separately approved.

### D009: Copy-in/copy-out is allowed for Windows mount MVP

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: MVP may implement filesystem semantics using copy-in/copy-out/import/export before live shared mounts.
- Consequence: Live VirtioFS/9p/custom sync are future improvements after validation.

### D010: Mount fidelity is product-level, not POSIX-perfect, for MVP

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Preserve product semantics: host source read-only from product perspective, guest writes isolated, explicit export. Do not require perfect POSIX live sharing in MVP.
- Consequence: Windows case, symlink, ACL, special-file, and file-watch differences must be documented and tested where supported.

### D011: Direct `:rw` host mounts are not in Windows MVP

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Windows MVP does not support direct host-write mounts.
- Consequence: Requests for `:rw` mounts on Windows must fail with a capability error unless a later decision enables them.

### D012: No QEMU user networking by default

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: The default Windows VM has no guest NIC and no arbitrary outbound network.
- Consequence: Do not use QEMU user networking as a convenience default.

### D013: Allowlisted egress must be strict

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Allowlisted networking must block arbitrary outbound egress, direct IP bypass, and non-proxied traffic unless explicitly allowed by policy.
- Consequence: QEMU NAT alone is insufficient. Egress policy lives in LocalSandbox-controlled code.

### D014: Windows Firewall is defense-in-depth, not MVP primary policy

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: MVP should not rely on Windows Firewall as the primary enforcement mechanism. Firewall integration may be added later for defense-in-depth or for specific network backends.
- Consequence: Avoid admin-permission design assumptions in MVP.

### D015: Port forwarding should preserve no-network semantics

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Host-to-guest port forwarding should work without giving the guest arbitrary outbound networking.
- Consequence: Prefer a LocalSandbox control/data channel over QEMU `hostfwd`; treat QEMU `hostfwd` as debug/temporary only.

### D016: Checkpoint MVP uses simple disk artifacts first

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Preserve product-level checkpoint semantics, but implement Windows MVP with immutable base plus per-sandbox writable disk/checkpoint artifacts before porting CAS/NBD.
- Consequence: Unix-socket NBD/CAS is not required for first Windows checkpoint milestone.

### D017: Rust CLI/backend ships before Node Windows package

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Implement and validate the Rust backend first. Add Windows Node packaging after core CLI smoke tests pass.
- Consequence: Node package changes should not block early backend milestones.

### D018: Self-hosted Windows 11 WHPX runner will be available

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Use GitHub-hosted Windows runners for compile/unit/golden tests and a self-hosted Windows 11 x86_64 runner for WHPX boot/network/mount/checkpoint smoke tests.
- Consequence: M15 must define labels and split test jobs accordingly.

### D019: Guest code is untrusted

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-07-02
- Decision: Treat guest code as untrusted. Host secrets are high-value. QEMU is part of the attack surface. Host filesystem and local sockets/pipes must be private and minimized.
- Consequence: Every milestone must pass the security checklist before completion.
