# M06: Virtio-Serial Control Transport

Status: Done
Depends on: See `00-index.md`
RFC sections: See `traceability.md`

## Objective

Connect host and guest using the existing `lsb-proto` frames over virtio-serial.

## Scope

- Add guest transport abstraction: vsock for macOS remains, virtio-serial for Windows added.
- Configure QEMU virtio-serial device and port.
- Use private Windows named pipe or chosen QEMU chardev backend.
- Implement host-side async stream wrapper.
- Add simple ping/echo or protocol-level smoke if available.

## Out of scope

- Do not replace `lsb-proto`.
- Do not adopt QGA for LocalSandbox guest APIs.
- Do not use hostfwd TCP as production control path.
- Do not break macOS vsock transport.

## Likely files / crates

- `crates/lsb-guest/src/main.rs` or transport modules
- `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/control/virtio_serial.rs`
- `crates/lsb-proto` only for transport-neutral helpers if needed

## Design notes

- Preserve existing macOS behavior unless the milestone explicitly states otherwise.
- Keep Windows-specific implementation behind platform/backend boundaries.
- Prefer precise capability errors over silent degradation.
- Update `state.md` when implementation reveals a better file layout or dependency.

## Tests to add or update

The specific tests should match the implementation, but this milestone must include enough validation to satisfy the acceptance criteria below. Prefer unit/golden/fake tests before requiring self-hosted integration tests.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Guest builds with both macOS/vsock and Windows/virtio-serial support.
- [x] Host opens control transport reliably during boot and exposes the established stream after boot. Self-hosted WHPX smoke showed QEMU `-chardev pipe` blocks boot until a host client connects, so LocalSandbox connects immediately after QEMU process start and clones the stored stream for later control callers. The M06 boot success path now requires serial evidence that the guest selected virtio-serial and opened the configured control port.
- [x] Protocol framing tests pass over in-memory and Windows transport where possible.
- [x] Timeouts produce clear diagnostics.

## Coding-agent prompt

You are implementing M06: Virtio-Serial Control Transport for the LocalSandbox Windows QEMU + WHPX port.

Read first:

Implement only this milestone. Preserve public CLI/SDK/Node APIs and existing macOS behavior. Add tests required by the milestone. Do not implement later milestones opportunistically. Update state.md and this milestone handoff before finishing.

## Handoff

- Branch/PR: `codex/windows-m06-virtio-serial-control`
- Summary: Added a platform-neutral host control stream boundary, Windows QEMU virtio-serial endpoint naming/opening, QEMU control chardev lifecycle wiring, guest virtio-serial transport selection/discovery, and focused protocol/endpoint/discovery tests. Self-hosted WHPX smoke proved the Windows QEMU pipe chardev must be connected during boot; the boot lifecycle now opens the pipe immediately after QEMU starts and keeps the established stream. Review follow-up tightened the M06 success path so generic serial output is not enough: `boot.status.json` reports `virtio_serial_control_observed_alive` only after `serial.log` shows guest virtio-serial transport selection and control-port open. No ready handshake, exec/file API parity, mux, mount, networking, checkpoint, or Node work was added.
- Tests run: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo check --workspace`; `cargo test --workspace`; `cargo check --workspace --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` (blocked by known macOS-host MSVC tooling gaps); `cargo check -p lsb-platform --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`; `cargo check -p lsb-platform --tests --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`; focused `lsb-platform`, `lsb-guest`, and `lsb-proto` tests; `./scripts/win-gh-test unit`; `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke` plus direct watch of run `28702513259` because the helper matched the prior unit run with the same head SHA.
- Debug artifacts: Latest passing stricter smoke run `28702513259`, Windows smoke/e2e job `85122795112`, artifact `windows-lsb-diagnostics` ID `8080640442`. `qemu.argv.redacted.txt` contains `virtio-serial-pci`, `virtserialport`, `lsb.transport=virtio-serial`, and `-nic none`; `boot.status.json` state is `virtio_serial_control_observed_alive` with success definition `qemu_process_alive_with_serial_output_and_virtio_serial_control_port_opened`; `serial.log` shows `lsb-guest` using virtio-serial and opening `/dev/vport1p1`. Self-hosted unit run `28702482071`, Windows job `85122675663`, artifact ID `8080623714`, also passed on the same commit.
- New decisions: D021 records the QEMU pipe connection ordering decision. D007 still selects virtio-serial over private Windows named pipe/QEMU chardev.
- New risks: No new risk record. R002 was moved to `Mitigating` with the observed connect-during-boot behavior; R003 remains `Mitigating` until M07 proves framed ready/control exchange over the opened virtio-serial stream.
- Next milestone: M07 guest ready handshake.

Security review:
- No-network default preserved: yes
- Secret redaction verified: yes, no protocol payload logging was added and QEMU argv diagnostics keep control pipe names redacted
- Host file exposure reviewed: yes, no new host file sharing was added
- Control/QMP endpoint privacy reviewed: partial, per-instance random pipe names are generated and self-hosted smoke validated same-user pipe connection ordering; QEMU-created named-pipe ACL behavior still needs hardening review before public runtime support
- Process cleanup reviewed: yes, endpoint lifetime is tied to the running boot object and QEMU cleanup remains under the existing supervisor/Job Object path
- New risks added to risk-register.md: no; existing R003 status updated
