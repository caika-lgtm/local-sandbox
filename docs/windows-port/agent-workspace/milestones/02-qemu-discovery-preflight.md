# M02: QEMU Discovery and WHPX Preflight

Status: Not started
Depends on: See `00-index.md`
RFC sections: See `traceability.md`

## Objective

Find `qemu-system-x86_64.exe`, validate that the host is eligible for production Windows runs, and provide actionable diagnostics.

## Scope

- Implement QEMU path discovery in priority order: explicit config/env, then PATH.
- Capture QEMU version.
- Validate Windows 11 x86_64 host assumption where feasible.
- Validate WHPX availability through safe preflight checks.
- Prepare or implement `lsb doctor windows` if the CLI architecture supports it.

## Out of scope

- Do not boot a VM.
- Do not use TCG in normal paths.
- Do not download or bundle QEMU.
- Do not require admin permissions for normal preflight.

## Likely files / crates

- `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/discovery.rs`
- `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/preflight.rs`
- `crates/lsb-cli` diagnostics path

## Design notes

- Preserve existing macOS behavior unless the milestone explicitly states otherwise.
- Keep Windows-specific implementation behind platform/backend boundaries.
- Prefer precise capability errors over silent degradation.
- Update `state.md` when implementation reveals a better file layout or dependency.

## Tests to add or update

The specific tests should match the implementation, but this milestone must include enough validation to satisfy the acceptance criteria below. Prefer unit/golden/fake tests before requiring self-hosted integration tests.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for discovery precedence.
- [ ] Diagnostics are specific for missing QEMU, unsupported version, non-Windows-11, WHPX unavailable.
- [ ] Redacted output avoids environment dumps.
- [ ] Manual/self-hosted evidence recorded in `state.md` if available.

## Coding-agent prompt

```text
You are implementing M02: QEMU Discovery and WHPX Preflight for the LocalSandbox Windows QEMU + WHPX port.

Read first:
- docs/windows-port/rfc-qemu-whpx.md

Implement only this milestone. Preserve public CLI/SDK/Node APIs and existing macOS behavior. Add tests required by the milestone. Do not implement later milestones opportunistically. Update state.md and this milestone handoff before finishing.
