# Windows Diagnostics Guide

Use this guide to keep Windows backend failures actionable and repeatable.

## Principles

- Prefer structured errors over raw strings.
- Include likely cause and remediation in user-facing diagnostics.
- Capture redacted QEMU argv for QEMU start/boot failures.
- Capture serial logs for boot and guest-agent failures.
- Never log secrets, proxy substitution values, or raw unredacted environment.
- Preserve temporary artifacts only through documented debug paths.

## Failure matrix

## Diagnostic directory

Windows boot/runtime artifacts are written under the instance diagnostics
directory, or under `LSB_WINDOWS_BOOT_ARTIFACT_DIR` for ignored smoke tests:

```text
<instance-dir>\diagnostics\
  qemu.argv.redacted.txt
  qemu.stderr.log
  qemu.stdout.log
  serial.log
  preflight.json
  qemu.status.json
  boot.status.json
  control.log.redacted     # if produced
  proxy.log.redacted       # if produced
  mux.log.redacted         # if produced
  watch.log.redacted       # if produced
```

Managed QEMU host-tool metadata lives under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\lsb\tools\qemu\
  current.json
  qemu-11.0.50-lsb0.4.0\
    manifest.json
    qemu-system-x86_64.exe
    qemu-img.exe
```

`preflight.json` records the selected QEMU source as `env`, `config`,
`managed`, or `path`. `environment.summary.json` records the managed
`current.json` path, package version, artifact SHA-256, and absolute executable
paths when available.

`boot.status.json` should include the advertised guest capabilities. Windows
streaming spawn and guest-side watch require `session_mux`; direct SMB mounts
require `cifs_mount`.

When SMB direct mounts are active, the instance directory root may also contain
`windows-smb-cleanup.json`; it is non-secret and transient.

For self-hosted workflow runs, the source diagnostics path is:

```text
C:\lsb-assets\work\<run-id>-<attempt>\diagnostics
```

Before upload, the collector stages files under the checkout:

```text
target\windows-lsb-diagnostics\lsb-assets-work\<run-id>-<attempt>\
```

The uploaded artifact is named `windows-lsb-diagnostics`.

## Diagnostic collector

`scripts/collect-windows-diagnostics.ps1` is the common hosted and self-hosted
collector.

Example usage:

```powershell
.\scripts\collect-windows-diagnostics.ps1

$env:LSB_WINDOWS_BOOT_ARTIFACT_DIR="C:\lsb-assets\work\<run-id>-<attempt>\diagnostics"
.\scripts\collect-windows-diagnostics.ps1 -StageRoot C:\tmp\lsb-diag

$env:LSB_DIAGNOSTICS_RUN_STARTED_UTC=(Get-Date).ToUniversalTime().AddMinutes(-30).ToString("o")
.\scripts\collect-windows-diagnostics.ps1 -IncludeRunnerLogs
```

The collector:

- deletes and recreates the stage root at startup,
- writes `environment.summary.json` and `diagnostics-manifest.json`,
- copies text-like diagnostic files only from the current run or explicit
  artifact directory,
- does not scan historical `C:\lsb-assets\work\*` directories,
- includes runner `_diag` logs only with a bounded start timestamp,
- filters runner logs to timestamped lines inside the bounded window plus
  continuations,
- timestamp-scopes workspace `target` logs when a run-start timestamp exists,
- records external persistent `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` caches as skipped instead of
  uploading them,
- probes managed QEMU executables by absolute path when `current.json` exists,
- allowlists environment capture rather than dumping the raw environment,
- redacts known secret values and common token/private-key patterns.

It must not upload raw environment dumps, boot assets, rootfs images, qcow2
disks, npm caches, private keys, stale stage-root contents, historical runner
log lines, persistent target-cache logs, or unredacted QEMU argv.

## SMB direct mount diagnostics

Windows SMB direct mounts create a transient `windows-smb-cleanup.json` file in
the instance directory after host resources are prepared. The manifest is used
only for stale recovery and contains generated user/share names, domains,
principals, paths, and access modes. It must not contain generated SMB
passwords, guest `MountRequest` payloads, proxy endpoints, or secret values.

Normal stop removes the manifest after share removal, ACL revoke, and user
delete complete. If cleanup fails or the host process exits before cleanup, a
later Windows startup scans stale instance manifests and retries cleanup
best-effort. Cleanup errors must stay sanitized and must not print passwords.

Direct SMB watch diagnostics should identify the guest watch path, whether the
watch was recursive, the matching direct SMB target, and the mount access mode.
They must not log generated passwords, guest `MountRequest` payloads, proxy
endpoints, raw file contents, or unredacted mux/watch payload bytes. A
`Windows direct SMB directory watch overflowed; resync the watched tree` error
means the caller must reconcile the watched tree before trusting later deltas.

## Boot/readiness diagnostics

Current Windows startup readiness is a valid LocalSandbox `GuestReady` frame
over the established virtio-serial control stream. `boot.status.json` records:

- `state: "guest_ready"`
- `success_definition: "localsandbox_guest_ready_frame_received_over_control_transport"`
- elapsed readiness time,
- protocol version,
- transport,
- guest version,
- advertised capabilities.

The raw `GuestReady` frame is sent before mux mode starts. After
`CAP_SESSION_MUX` is advertised, the Windows mux manager owns the physical
control pipe and all later exec, file, mount init, and guest watch control
traffic should use virtual sessions. If a failure suggests multiple independent
readers on the physical pipe, treat it as a transport bug.

Important boot signatures:

- `-cpu max` plus WHPX APX/MPX warnings and `WHPX: Unexpected VP exit code 4`
  indicates the known CPU model/WHPX compatibility failure. The production path
  uses `-cpu Westmere`; do not add TCG fallback for normal runs.
- Empty `serial.log` while QEMU stays alive is not success. Inspect kernel
  console configuration, serial device argv, and `qemu.stderr.log`.
- If QEMU exits while opening the control pipe, report QEMU/process context
  rather than a generic control-open timeout.
- Invalid ready frames should report frame type and payload length, not raw
  payload bytes.

## Mux, spawn, and watch diagnostics

Mux diagnostics must be metadata-only. Safe fields include session id, session
kind, frame type names, byte counts, credit/window counters, queue lengths,
sanitized open/reject/reset reasons, and elapsed times. Unsafe fields include
raw `EXEC_REQ`, `STDIN`, stdout/stderr bytes, `WATCH_EVENT` payloads with
unreviewed paths, SMB credentials, secret placeholders or values, and raw guest
environment dumps.

For a spawn hang:

- Confirm `boot.status.json` lists `session_mux`.
- Reproduce with a small stdout command, a large-output command, and a
  concurrent small command to distinguish guest process bugs from mux
  backpressure.
- Check whether `KILL` or stdin writes make progress while another session is
  stdout-heavy.
- Capture sanitized mux close/reset reasons and byte counters, not process
  payload bytes.

For guest-side watch failures:

- Confirm the requested path is not under a Windows direct SMB target; public
  SDK/Node watch routes those paths to the host watcher before opening a guest
  watch session.
- Capture the guest path, recursive flag, mux watch-session close reason, and
  any sanitized watch error.
- Remember that overlay/import mounts are staged guest copies on Windows; a
  later host-side source edit is not expected to appear unless the path is an
  explicit direct SMB mount.

For direct SMB watch failures:

- Confirm the path is at or below one configured direct SMB guest target.
- Recursive watch roots that are ancestors of direct SMB targets should fail
  with a precise unsupported error; this is expected until a hybrid aggregator
  is designed.
- Capture the sanitized `WindowsHostWatchError`, SMB policy diagnosis, cleanup
  manifest status, and whether normal direct SMB file visibility still works.
- If overflow is reported, resync the watched tree before relying on later
  events.

## Port forwarding diagnostics

Windows port forwarding uses a dedicated private virtio-serial port named
`org.localsandbox.forward`. Normal product forwarding must not add QEMU
`hostfwd`, QEMU user networking, TAP/bridged networking, or a guest NIC.

Actionable checks:

- Bind failure: confirm no process owns `127.0.0.1:<host_port>` and the host
  port is nonzero.
- Guest unavailable: check `boot.status.json`, serial tail, and whether
  startup reached guest ready.
- Guest refused connection: verify the service is listening inside the guest on
  `127.0.0.1:<guest_port>`.
- Immediate host connect refused after LocalSandbox reports forwarding: inspect
  listener lifecycle. A stale initial terminal VM state must not close the
  listener before `Running` has been observed.
- Forwarding channel closed: inspect guest forwarding logs and QEMU lifecycle
  artifacts.

Do not log forwarded payload bytes.

## Network/proxy diagnostics

Default Windows QEMU argv must contain `-nic none` and no `-netdev`.

With allow-net/proxy configuration, Windows attaches the guest NIC only to a
LocalSandbox-owned loopback proxy stream:

```text
-netdev stream,id=lsbproxy0,server=off,addr.type=inet,addr.host=127.0.0.1,addr.port=<proxy-port>
-device virtio-net-pci,netdev=lsbproxy0,mac=<proxy-mac>
```

Diagnostics redact the ephemeral proxy port and generated local MAC.

Treat as security bugs:

- default sandbox has outbound network,
- blocked domain/direct IP/missing domain succeeds,
- forged allowed Host/SNI to unrelated destination IP succeeds,
- secret appears in QEMU argv, guest env, serial log, proxy log, or diagnostics,
- generated SMB password appears in cleanup manifests, QEMU argv, guest argv,
  guest env, serial log, proxy log, or uploaded diagnostics,
- proxy thread or host secret config survives VM teardown.

Logs may include sanitized domain names, policy decision names, local ephemeral
ports, and high-level errors. They must not include proxy payloads, literal host
secret values, unredacted guest environment dumps, or full unredacted QEMU argv.

## CI diagnostic bundle checks

Hosted Windows CI uploads `windows-hosted-rust-diagnostics` on failure. This is
compile/unit/golden-only and should not contain WHPX smoke artifacts.

The manual self-hosted WHPX workflow uploads:

- `windows-lsb-diagnostics-probe` after smoke/e2e cache probes,
- `windows-lsb-diagnostics` after `check`, `unit`, `smoke`, and `e2e` lanes.

If a failure needs a file not present in `diagnostics-manifest.json`, add a
redacted text artifact at the producer or extend the collector allowlist
deliberately. Do not broaden the workflow to upload arbitrary directories.
