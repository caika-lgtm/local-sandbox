# Windows Port MVP Handoff

Last updated: 2026-07-06

## Summary

The Windows port MVP implements a native Windows 11 x64 LocalSandbox backend
using QEMU with WHPX. The implementation keeps the existing Linux guest model
and public LocalSandbox API shape while replacing the macOS Apple
Virtualization.framework backend with a supervised QEMU process. Release
packaging now includes Windows x64 CLI install artifacts and the Windows x64
Node package, plus Windows x64 runtime assets for the QEMU/WHPX guest path.

This handoff replaces the completed sprint workspace and milestone prompt files.
It is the current status source for future agents.

## Implemented

| Area | Current behavior |
|---|---|
| Host target | Windows 11 x64. Windows ARM64 is future work. |
| VM backend | QEMU direct Linux boot with `-accel whpx`, `-cpu Westmere`, explicit devices, no display, no default NIC, and Windows Job Object cleanup. |
| QEMU discovery | `LSB_QEMU`, internal config hook, managed QEMU, then `PATH`; structured preflight errors for missing QEMU, invalid paths, version parse, and missing WHPX support. |
| Managed QEMU | `lsb init` installs the pinned Windows x86_64 QEMU package under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\lsb\tools\qemu`, validates artifact SHA-256, safe extraction, manifest executable paths, required notices, and writes `current.json`. |
| Boot assets | Released Windows x64 runtime assets provide `Image`, `initramfs.cpio.gz`, and `rootfs.ext4` with the QEMU/WHPX guest requirements such as virtio-serial. Developers should use `lsb init`; self-hosted CI hydrates/caches assets and prepares disposable per-run rootfs copies. |
| Control transport | `lsb-proto` over virtio-serial through private QEMU pipe chardevs. The host connects during boot because QEMU pipe chardev startup can block until a client connects. |
| Readiness | Windows startup succeeds only after a valid LocalSandbox `GuestReady` frame over the established control stream. |
| Exec | Non-interactive `exec` works through the existing product API and returns stdout, stderr, and exit status. |
| File transfer | Copy-in/copy-out helpers stream guest file content over the control path with validation for path traversal, chunk sizes, final byte counts, and overwrite behavior. |
| Mounts | Windows overlay-style mounts are snapshot imports: host directory data is copied into guest staging and used as the overlay lowerdir. Guest writes stay isolated. |
| Port forwarding | Host-to-guest forwarding uses a dedicated private virtio-serial channel and host listeners bound to `127.0.0.1`. It does not enable a guest NIC or QEMU `hostfwd`. |
| Networking | Default argv remains `-nic none`. Existing allow-net/proxy configuration attaches a QEMU stream netdev only to a LocalSandbox-owned loopback proxy path. |
| Secrets | Guest environment values are placeholders. Host-side proxy policy performs substitution only for configured destinations. Diagnostics redact secret-bearing values. |
| Checkpoints | Windows checkpoints use private per-instance qcow2 overlays and flattened qcow2 checkpoint artifacts plus JSON metadata. macOS CAS/NBD behavior is unchanged. |
| CLI release/install | Release CI builds a Windows x64 CLI archive containing `lsb.exe`. `install.ps1` supports native PowerShell installs, and `install.sh` supports Git Bash/MSYS/Cygwin installs. After CLI installation, `lsb init` installs the managed QEMU host-tool package. |
| Node binding | Windows x64 package metadata and `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` NAPI target wiring exist. Node `Sandbox.start()` surfaces Rust backend/preflight error chains. |
| CI | Hosted Windows CI runs compile/unit/golden coverage without QEMU/WHPX. The self-hosted Windows 11 WHPX workflow runs e2e on trusted `main` pushes and supports manual check, unit, smoke, and e2e lanes. |
| Diagnostics | QEMU argv, stdout/stderr, serial log, preflight, boot status, environment summary, and manifest are collected through a redacted diagnostic collector. |

## Intentional MVP limitations

- No Windows ARM64 support.
- No QEMU bundled inside CLI archives, OS runtime assets, or npm packages.
- No normal TCG fallback. Production Windows execution requires WHPX.
- No direct writable host mounts are implemented in the current Windows MVP.
  D024 accepts a follow-up SMB/CIFS direct-mount path.
- No live host/guest mount synchronization for overlay, no-suffix, or CLI `:ro`
  mounts. Planned SMB/CIFS direct mounts are the only approved live-sharing path.
- No file `watch` support for live host changes on imported mounts.
- No interactive shell or streaming `spawn`/kill on Windows.
- No general mux/session model yet. Non-interactive exec and file transfer are
  serialized on the control stream; port forwarding uses a separate forwarding
  channel and currently serializes active forwarding sessions.
- No CAS/NBD checkpoint parity on Windows.
- Windows SDK `checkpoint()` stops the VM before flattening the active qcow2
  overlay into a checkpoint artifact. This is not live checkpointing.
- Managed QEMU is pinned to QEMU 11.0.50 package `qemu-11.0.50-lsb0.4.0`; broader minimum-version policy for overrides remains future work.
- No `lsb doctor windows` command yet, though preflight internals and
  diagnostics support that future command.
- Native Windows build-number probing is deferred.
- Self-hosted runner labels still use the default `self-hosted, Windows, X64`
  set and assume one persistent WHPX runner for smoke/e2e cache reuse.

## Accepted post-MVP direct-mount direction

Windows direct directory mounts will use SMB/CIFS once the follow-up
implementation slices land. The public API shape remains unchanged:

- CLI no-suffix mounts and CLI `:ro` mounts stay overlay snapshot imports.
- CLI `:rw` plus `--allow-host-writes` becomes an SMB/CIFS direct read-write
  mount and requires an elevated Administrator shell.
- SDK and Node `Direct { flags: 0 }` become SMB/CIFS direct read-write mounts.
- SDK and Node `Direct { flags: MS_RDONLY }` become SMB/CIFS direct read-only
  mounts.
- SMB direct mounts must not imply arbitrary outbound `allow_net`; they use the
  LocalSandbox-controlled proxy path.

Until implementation and WHPX smoke validation are complete, this section is a
planning status update rather than a supported runtime behavior claim.

## Important implementation notes

- `lsb-platform::windows_x86_64` owns QEMU discovery, preflight, argv building,
  process supervision, boot, control transport, filesystem planning, network
  attachment, and backend startup glue.
- QEMU commands are constructed as structured argv values. Do not shell-concat
  QEMU commands.
- The Windows QEMU direct boot path uses `-cpu Westmere`. A self-hosted run with
  `-cpu max` on QEMU 11.0.50 failed before serial output with APX/MPX warnings
  and `WHPX: Unexpected VP exit code 4`; see D020.
- The control pipe must be connected during boot. A self-hosted M06 run showed
  QEMU pipe chardev startup can block guest boot until the host connects; see
  D021.
- Mount import validation is conservative: traversal, reparse points,
  symlinks/junctions, hardlinks, special files, case-insensitive collisions, and
  plan-to-open replacement are rejected or fail closed.
- Windows path validation accepts canonicalized drive-verbatim paths such as
  `\\?\C:\...` because `std::fs::canonicalize` returns that shape on Windows.
  UNC verbatim and device paths remain unsupported.
- Allow-net on Windows uses `-netdev stream` to a LocalSandbox-owned loopback
  proxy endpoint. QEMU user networking, `hostfwd`, TAP, bridge, NAT, and
  non-loopback proxy endpoints remain unsupported product paths.
- Explicit network allowlists bind policy-visible SNI/HTTP Host values to
  recent proxy DNS A answers before upstream connect and before secret
  substitution. Direct IP, missing-domain, non-allowlisted-domain, and forged
  allowed Host/SNI-to-arbitrary-IP traffic fail closed.
- Windows checkpoint save writes metadata only after `qemu-img convert` succeeds
  and refuses same-name `.qcow2`, `.json`, `.idx`, or `.ext4` conflicts.

The last full WHPX smoke pass, run `28743977168`, happened before later
diagnostics scoping follow-up commits. Before treating the branch as fully
current for upstream review, rerun `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke` at final branch
head.

## Open production-readiness gaps

- Rerun self-hosted WHPX smoke at final branch head after diagnostics collector
  scoping changes.
- Decide and document the support policy for user override QEMU versions.
- Decide whether managed QEMU artifacts need additional signing or mirroring in
  a later Windows release.
- Add a Windows diagnostic command such as `lsb doctor windows`.
- Decide dedicated self-hosted runner labels before adding more Windows runners
  with the default `self-hosted, Windows, X64` labels.
- Define the mux/session model before enabling Windows interactive shell,
  streaming spawn, kill, watch, or concurrent forwarding sessions.
- Decide the post-MVP storage path: CAS/NBD migration, persistent qcow2 chains,
  or another deduplicated checkpoint format.
- Implement and validate the accepted SMB/CIFS direct-mount plan, then revisit
  broader live-sharing work such as Windows VirtioFS, 9p, or custom sync only if
  needed.
