# Windows Risk Register

Track Windows backend risks here. Update this file when evidence changes a risk.

| ID | Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Status | Owner |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|
| R001 | QEMU + WHPX availability varies across Windows machines | High | Medium | Strict preflight; actionable diagnostics; Windows 11 x64 support boundary | Open | TBD |
| R002 | Virtio-serial named pipe behavior differs across QEMU versions | High | Medium | Self-hosted WHPX smoke proved current pipe ordering; host connects during boot and keeps established stream | Mitigating | TBD |
| R003 | Guest transport regression from adding virtio-serial beside vsock | High | Low | Guest keeps macOS vsock path; Windows readiness/exec smokes validate virtio-serial | Retired | TBD |
| R004 | Windows filesystem semantics differ from macOS VirtioFS overlay semantics | High | High | Snapshot import/export for overlay mounts; SMB/CIFS for explicit direct mounts; conservative reparse/hardlink/case-collision policy; document mode-specific semantics | Mitigating | TBD |
| R005 | Windows proxy attachment could bypass LocalSandbox policy | High | Medium | Windows uses LocalSandbox-owned loopback stream netdev, rejects legacy fd/socketpair/non-loopback paths, and tests direct-IP/forged-host denial | Mitigating | TBD |
| R006 | Windows checkpoint store lacks CAS/NBD parity | Medium | High | MVP uses flattened qcow2 artifacts; future storage work must choose CAS/NBD, qcow2 chains, or another deduplicated format | Accepted | TBD |
| R007 | Hosted CI cannot run WHPX | Medium | High | Hosted CI is compile/unit/golden only; manual self-hosted Windows 11 runner covers WHPX runtime | Accepted | Maintainer |
| R008 | Managed QEMU artifact provenance/security | Medium | Medium | `lsb init` verifies pinned artifact SHA-256, manifest paths, required notices, and diagnostics record managed package/source; release CI validates artifact availability/hash | Mitigating | Release owner |
| R009 | Process cleanup leaves QEMU running after host crash/test timeout | High | Medium | Windows Job Object cleanup; fake process tests; periodic runner process checks | Mitigating | TBD |
| R010 | Network policy bypass through accidental NIC/user networking | High | Medium | Golden/unit/smoke coverage asserts `-nic none` by default, stream proxy only for allow-net, no QEMU user networking/hostfwd/TAP/bridge | Mitigating | TBD |
| R011 | Public API drift while adding Windows capability errors | Medium | Medium | API-shape tests; keep platform-specific detail below SDK/CLI/Node surfaces | Open | TBD |
| R012 | Boot asset compatibility differs between QEMU and Apple VZ | High | Medium | Self-hosted boot smoke; x86_64 serial console config; preserve guest asset invariants | Mitigating | TBD |
| R013 | Default self-hosted Windows labels can route cache probe and smoke jobs to different machines if runner pool grows | Medium | Medium | Current docs record the single-runner assumption, keep the workflow off pull requests, and limit automatic hardware execution to trusted `main` e2e runs. Add a dedicated label or disable local-cache skip path before adding runners. | Open | Maintainer |
| R014 | Historical missing mux/session model blocked streaming spawn, shell, watch, and concurrent forwarding | Medium | High | Session mux is implemented for Windows exec, file, mount init, spawn, and guest watch. Interactive shell and concurrent forwarding remain separate future work. | Retired | TBD |
| R015 | Override QEMU version policy is not finalized | Medium | Medium | Standard path pins managed QEMU 11.0.50; test and document support expectations for `LSB_QEMU`/PATH overrides | Open | Release owner |
| R016 | Windows SMB direct mount host resources could remain after crash or partial failure | High | Medium | In-memory cleanup guards, non-secret cleanup manifests, startup stale recovery scan, fake cleanup tests, and WHPX smoke cleanup checks | Mitigating | TBD |
| R017 | Direct SMB watch can overflow or lose useful deltas under high host filesystem churn | Medium | Medium | Host watcher surfaces overflow as an error, diagnostics tell callers to resync, and future work tracks high-churn/large-tree validation plus any explicit resync API | Mitigating | TBD |

## Status values

- `Open`: active risk.
- `Mitigating`: implementation reduces but does not eliminate the risk.
- `Accepted`: known tradeoff accepted for the current support level.
- `Retired`: validation or implementation materially removed the risk.

## Adding risks

Add a risk when implementation or review discovers uncertainty that affects
security, product semantics, CI reliability, release readiness, or user-visible
support boundaries.
