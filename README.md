# lsb

lsb (Local SandBox) is a local-first microVM sandbox for AI agents on macOS and
Windows 11 x64.

lsb boots lightweight Linux VMs using Apple's Virtualization.framework on macOS
and QEMU with WHPX on Windows. Each sandbox is ephemeral: the rootfs resets on
every run, giving agents a disposable environment to execute code, install
packages, and run tools without touching your host.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later on Apple Silicon or Intel, or Windows 11 on x64.
- Windows requires Windows 11 x64 with Windows Hypervisor Platform enabled.
  `lsb init` installs LocalSandbox-managed QEMU host tools under the user data
  directory and production Windows runs require WHPX; they do not fall back to
  TCG. `LSB_QEMU` and `LSB_QEMU_IMG` remain supported override/debug paths.
- `cmake` is required when building from source because `lsb-proxy` links
  BoringSSL for upstream TLS.
- Windows source builds require the Rust MSVC toolchain and native build tools.

## Install

Install the latest CLI release on macOS:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LocalSandBox/local-sandbox/main/install.sh | sh
```

Install the latest CLI release on Windows 11 x64 from PowerShell:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LocalSandBox/local-sandbox/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The shell installer also supports Windows x64 when run from Git Bash, MSYS2, or
Cygwin. After installation, run `lsb init` to download managed QEMU host tools
and runtime assets. To update a Windows CLI install, rerun the PowerShell
installer.

Build the macOS CLI from source:

```sh
cargo build -p lsb-cli --release
codesign --entitlements lsb.entitlements --force -s - target/release/lsb
```

Build the Windows CLI from source:

```powershell
cargo build -p lsb-cli --release
target\release\lsb.exe init
```

`cargo build` only builds the CLI. Runtime assets are downloaded separately by
`lsb init` and include `Image`, `initramfs.cpio.gz`, and `rootfs.ext4`. On
Windows, `lsb init` also installs managed QEMU host tools under
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\lsb\tools\qemu` without mutating global `PATH`. Windows uses its
own released runtime asset package because the QEMU/WHPX guest path requires
Windows-specific support such as virtio-serial. Building those assets from
source on Windows is more involved; developers should normally download the
released runtime assets instead of running the rootfs preparation pipeline
locally.

## Usage

```sh
# Interactive shell (macOS)
lsb run

# Run a command (macOS and Windows)
lsb run -- echo hello

# With network access
lsb run --allow-net

# Restrict to specific hosts
lsb run --allow-net --allow-host api.openai.com --allow-host registry.npmjs.org

# Custom resources
lsb run --cpus 4 --memory 4096 --disk-size 8192 -- make -j4
```

## Platform Support

| Host | Runtime backend | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS 14+ Apple Silicon | Apple Virtualization.framework | Supported |
| macOS 14+ Intel x64 | Apple Virtualization.framework | Supported |
| Windows 11 x64 | QEMU with WHPX | Supported backend and Node package |
| Windows ARM64 | Not available | Planned |

Windows support covers sandbox start/stop, non-interactive `exec`, streaming
`spawn` with stdin/kill, guest file APIs, file `watch`, overlay mounts,
explicit SMB/CIFS direct mounts, loopback port forwarding, policy-mediated
proxy networking, and qcow2 checkpoint save/restore. Interactive shells,
Windows ARM64, and CAS/NBD checkpoints are not part of the Windows support
surface yet.

With `--allow-net`, the guest resolves DNS through the host-side proxy at
`10.0.0.1`. Leave `/etc/resolv.conf` pointed at that proxy; the proxy performs
lookups with the host system resolver, including VPN or split-DNS rules.
Directly configuring corporate DNS servers inside the guest bypasses the proxy
and can fail because the guest has no general UDP or host VPN route access.

### Directory mounts

Mount host directories into the VM. On macOS, lsb uses VirtioFS with a guest
overlay. On Windows, CLI mounts without a suffix and CLI `:ro` mounts import a
snapshot into guest-owned staging storage; guest writes do not modify the host
source and are discarded when the VM exits unless you save or export them
through an explicit API.

Windows CLI `:rw` mounts use SMB/CIFS direct read-write sharing and require both
`--allow-host-writes` and an elevated Administrator shell. SDK and Node direct
mounts use the existing `Direct` API: `flags: 0` is SMB/CIFS read-write and
`flags: 1` (`MS_RDONLY`) is SMB/CIFS read-only. Direct SMB mounts use the
LocalSandbox-controlled proxy path and do not imply arbitrary outbound
`--allow-net`. If local Windows policy denies network logon to
`NT AUTHORITY\Local account`, direct SMB mounts fail before boot with an
actionable preflight error; diagnose or repair that policy with
`lsb doctor windows-smb-policy`.

On Windows, `watch()` on normal guest paths and overlay/import mounts observes
the guest filesystem view. `watch()` on SDK or Node direct SMB mount paths uses
a host-side Windows directory watcher so host-originated changes and
guest-originated CIFS writes are reported through the same event shape. A
recursive watch above a direct SMB mount target is rejected instead of returning
partial guest-only coverage; watch the SMB target directly or start separate
watches.

```sh
# Mount a directory (guest can write, host is untouched)
lsb run --mount ./src:/workspace -- ls /workspace

# Windows explicit direct read-write mount (requires Administrator)
lsb run --allow-host-writes --mount ./src:/workspace:rw -- sh

# Multiple mounts
lsb run --mount ./src:/workspace --mount ./data:/data -- sh
```

Mounts can also be set in `lsb.json` (see [Config file](#config-file)).

> **Note:** Directory mounts require checkpoints created on v0.1.11+. Existing checkpoints work normally for all other features. Run `lsb upgrade` to get the latest version.

### Port forwarding

Forward host ports to guest ports over a private host/guest channel. macOS uses
vsock; Windows uses a private virtio-serial channel. Port forwarding works
without `--allow-net`; the guest needs no general network device.

```sh
# Install python3 into a checkpoint, then serve with port forwarding
lsb checkpoint create py --allow-net -- apt-get install -y python3
lsb run --from py -p 8080:8000 -- python3 -m http.server 8000

# From the host (in another terminal)
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/

# Multiple ports
lsb run -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 -- nginx
```

Port forwards can also be set in `lsb.json` (see [Config file](#config-file)).

### Checkpoints

Checkpoints save the disk state so you can reuse an environment across runs.
On macOS, checkpoints are CAS/NBD indexes that reference a pinned base rootfs by
runtime asset version. On Windows, checkpoints are flattened qcow2 disk
artifacts over immutable base images. After `rootfs.ext4` is updated, new
sandboxes use the new base and existing checkpoints continue to use the base
they were created from.

```sh
# Initialize the current CLI version and boot from that current base
lsb init
lsb run -- sh

# Set up an environment and save it
lsb checkpoint create myenv --allow-net -- sh -c 'apt-get install -y python3 gcc'

# Run from a checkpoint (ephemeral -- changes are discarded)
lsb run --from myenv -- python3 script.py

# Branch from an existing checkpoint
lsb checkpoint create myenv2 --from myenv --allow-net -- sh -c 'pip install numpy'

# Optional: prepare and boot from a specific older pinned base version
lsb init --version 0.3.8
lsb run --base-version 0.3.8 -- sh

# List and delete
lsb checkpoint list
lsb checkpoint delete myenv
```

### Secrets

Secrets keep API keys on the host. The guest receives a random placeholder token; the proxy substitutes the real value only on HTTPS requests to the specified hosts. The real secret never enters the VM.

```sh
# Inject a secret via CLI
lsb run --allow-net --secret API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key@api.openai.com -- curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models

# Multiple secrets
lsb run --allow-net \
  --secret API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key@api.openai.com \
  --secret GH_TOKEN=github_pat_your_token@api.github.com \
  -- sh
```

Format: `NAME=VALUE@host1,host2` — `NAME` is the env var the guest sees, `VALUE` is the literal secret held on the host, and hosts are where the proxy substitutes it.

Secrets can also be set in `lsb.json` (see [Config file](#config-file)).

### Config file

lsb loads `lsb.json` from the current directory (or `--config PATH`). All fields are optional; CLI flags take precedence.

```json
{
  "cpus": 4,
  "memory": 4096,
  "disk_size": 8192,
  "allow_net": true,
  "ports": ["8080:80"],
  "mounts": ["./src:/workspace", "./data:/data"],
  "command": ["python", "script.py"],
  "secrets": {
    "API_KEY": {
      "value": "sk-your-openai-key",
      "hosts": ["api.openai.com"]
    }
  },
  "network": {
    "allow": ["api.openai.com", "registry.npmjs.org"]
  }
}
```

The `network.allow` list restricts which hosts the guest can reach. Omit it to allow all hosts.

## Node.js Binding

Use lsb programmatically from Node.js or TypeScript with the
[`@local-sandbox/lsb-nodejs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@local-sandbox/lsb-nodejs)
package. The package supports macOS arm64/x64 and Windows x64.

```sh
npm install @local-sandbox/lsb-nodejs
```

```ts
import { Sandbox } from "@local-sandbox/lsb-nodejs";

const sb = await Sandbox.start({ from: "python-env" });

const result = await sb.exec("python3 -c 'print(1+1)'");
console.log(result.stdout); // "2\n"

await sb.checkpoint("after-run"); // saves disk state and stops the VM
```

See the [Node.js binding README](bindings/nodejs/README.md) for full API docs and runtime requirements.

## Agent Skill

lsb ships as an [agent skill](https://agentskills.io) so AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) can use it automatically.

```sh
# Install via Vercel's skills CLI
npx skills add LocalSandBox/local-sandbox

# Or manually copy into your project
cp -r skills/lsb .claude/skills/lsb
```

Once installed, agents will use `lsb run` whenever they need sandboxed execution.
