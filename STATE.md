# Windows SMB Direct Mounts Implementation State

This file is for implementation agents to keep progress, decisions, blockers,
and validation results synchronized while implementing `PLAN.md`.

## Current Status

- Overall status: Slice 7 implementation complete locally; self-hosted Windows
  smoke found readiness, SMB mount-preflight, CIFS UTF-8 kernel config, and SMB
  loopback server-name gaps, SMB policy-deny gaps, a CLI `:ro` smoke
  fixture/script quoting gap, and Windows SMB cleanup/redaction review issues;
  fixes are in the working tree and rerun is pending
- Current owner: Codex
- Current branch: codex/lsb-direct-mnt
- Last updated: 2026-07-07
- Latest validated commit: working tree Slice 7 edits on codex/lsb-direct-mnt

## Active Focus

- Current task: Slice 7 Windows smoke tests, SMB recovery/cleanup hardening,
  redaction scans, and docs finalization
- Relevant files: Windows smoke scripts, Node smoke script, Windows SMB
  lifecycle/recovery, Sandbox SMB cleanup wiring, docs, `STATE.md`
- Immediate next step: Amend/commit the smoke-discovered fixes, then rerun
  `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke`.
- Blockers: Self-hosted Windows helper requires a clean committed working tree.

## Maintainer Decisions

- [x] Use SMB/CIFS for Windows direct directory mounts.
- [x] Preserve macOS-like direct semantics, including `:rw`.
- [x] Require Administrator for Windows SMB direct mounts.
- [x] Use the LocalSandbox controlled proxy path.
- [x] Do not use QEMU user networking, `hostfwd`, TAP, bridge, NAT, or public
  listener paths.
- [x] Create ephemeral Windows SMB shares.
- [x] Create ephemeral Windows users and generated SMB credentials.
- [x] Recursive validation for direct mounts is required.
- [x] Keep CLI `:ro` as overlay.
- [x] Do not enable SMB encryption by default.
- [x] Use one ephemeral Windows user per sandbox.
- [x] Update both kernel configs.

## Progress Checklist

- [x] Update Windows decision docs to supersede the old no-direct-rw decision.
- [x] Enable CIFS client support in both kernel configs.
- [x] Add `cifs-utils` to the rootfs package list.
- [x] Add `MountRequest::Smb`.
- [x] Add `cifs_mount` guest capability.
- [x] Add protocol redaction tests for SMB credentials.
- [x] Implement guest `mount.cifs` path using `PASSWD_FD`.

- [x] Add CLI detection/startup for mount-only SMB proxy.
- [x] Add SDK detection/startup for mount-only SMB proxy.
- [x] Preserve Node API shape and direct flag mapping.
- [x] Add Windows direct SMB mount planning.
- [x] Add recursive direct path validation.

The next CLI `:ro` overlay smoke failed with guest exit code 1 because the smoke fixture used PowerShell `Out-File`, which writes CRLF/trailing-newline content; Linux command substitution strips LF but leaves `\r`, so the exact string assertion failed. |

The live-lock recovery regression is Windows-only and will execute in Windows unit CI. |
| 2026-07-07 | working tree | `cargo fmt --all`; `cargo test -p lsb-cli`; `git diff --check` | Pass | Review fix: CLI console mode now uses the prepared proxy config and passes the proxy-backed network attachment into sandbox construction, so Windows direct SMB mounts and `--allow-net` console runs do not drop proxy networking. |

## Smoke Test State

- Non-admin preflight failure: Unit-covered by SMB lifecycle fake admin test;
  hardware smoke pending.
- Admin rw direct mount guest-to-host write: Covered by
  `windows_qemu_direct_smb_mount_smoke`; hardware smoke pending.
- Admin rw direct mount host-to-guest visibility: Covered by
  `windows_qemu_direct_smb_mount_smoke`; hardware smoke pending.
- SDK/Node direct read-only write denial: Node smoke covers
  `flags: MS_RDONLY`; hardware smoke pending.
- CLI `:ro` overlay compatibility: `scripts/windows-smoke.ps1` runs a CLI
  `:ro` overlay smoke with newline-free fixtures and labelled guest diagnostics;
  hardware rerun pending after fixture fix.
- CLI `--console` direct SMB proxy attachment: `scripts/windows-smoke.ps1` now
  starts a CLI `:rw` direct SMB mount in console mode without `--allow-net` and
  waits for `lsb: VM started`, proving mount initialization completed through
  the mount-only SMB proxy; hardware rerun pending.
- Mount-only proxy no arbitrary outbound network: Covered by SDK direct SMB
  smoke and existing proxy policy tests; hardware smoke pending.
- Cleanup leaves no LocalSandbox shares: Covered by SDK direct SMB smoke and
  VM failure-cleanup smoke; hardware smoke pending.
- Cleanup leaves no LocalSandbox users: Covered by SDK direct SMB smoke and VM
  failure-cleanup smoke; hardware smoke pending.
- Cleanup removes NTFS ACL grants: Covered by SDK direct SMB smoke; hardware
  smoke pending.
- Failure injection cleanup: Covered by fake-manager tests and missing-proxy VM
  smoke; hardware smoke pending.
