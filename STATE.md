# Windows SMB Direct Mounts Implementation State

This file is for implementation agents to keep progress, decisions, blockers,
and validation results synchronized while implementing `PLAN.md`.

## Current Status

- Overall status: Slice 5 Windows SMB host lifecycle implemented; scoped
  validation passing
- Current owner: Codex
- Current branch: codex/lsb-direct-mnt
- Last updated: 2026-07-06
- Latest validated commit: 9ab5fa9 plus uncommitted Slice 5 lifecycle edits

## Active Focus

- Current task: Slice 5 Windows SMB host lifecycle
- Relevant files: `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/fs/smb/`,
  `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/fs/mod.rs`,
  `crates/lsb-platform/Cargo.toml`,
  `STATE.md`
- Immediate next step: Begin Slice 6 mount planning and sandbox lifecycle
  integration after review.
- Blockers: None for Slice 5.

## Maintainer Decisions

- [x] Use SMB/CIFS for Windows direct directory mounts.
- [x] Preserve macOS-like direct semantics, including `:rw`.
- [x] Require Administrator for Windows SMB direct mounts.
- [x] Use the LocalSandbox controlled proxy path.
- [x] Do not use QEMU user networking, `hostfwd`, TAP, bridge, NAT, or public
  listener paths.
- [x] Create ephemeral Windows SMB shares.
- [x] Create ephemeral Windows users and generated SMB credentials.
- [x] Recursive validation for direct mounts is required.
- [x] Keep CLI `:ro` as overlay.
- [x] Do not enable SMB encryption by default.
- [x] Use one ephemeral Windows user per sandbox.
- [x] Update both kernel configs.

## Progress Checklist

- [x] Update Windows decision docs to supersede the old no-direct-rw decision.

| 2026-07-06 | 0febf44 + working tree | `cargo check --workspace` | Blocked | Fails because `crates/lsb-vm/src/sandbox.rs` has an exhaustive `MountRequest` match missing `Smb`; `lsb-vm` is outside the requested touch list. |
| 2026-07-06 | 0febf44 + working tree | `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo check --workspace`; `cargo test -p lsb-vm` | Pass | Minimal `lsb-vm` exhaustiveness update restored workspace compilation without SMB lifecycle/startup behavior. |
| 2026-07-06 | 0febf44 + working tree | `cargo fmt --check`; `cargo test -p lsb-proxy`; `git diff --check` | Pass | Slice 3 proxy policy tests cover mount-only SMB relay, arbitrary TCP/DNS denial, no secret substitutions in mount-only mode, and combined network-plus-SMB behavior. |

QEMU/network tests cover default `-nic none`, QEMU stream netdev attachment, loopback-only endpoints, and no user networking/hostfwd/TAP/bridge/NAT tokens. |

Windows target check covers native admin/user/share/ACL API adapters. |

## Changed Files Tracker

Use this section to summarize intentional changes. Do not include generated
artifacts unless they are intentionally checked in.

| File | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/windows-port/decisions.md` | Updated | Added D024, superseded D011, and scoped D010 for explicit SMB direct mounts. |
| `docs/windows-port/README.md` | Updated | Added accepted direct-mount plan and current planning-status caveat. |
| `docs/windows-port/mvp-handoff.md` | Updated | Separated current MVP limitations from the accepted post-MVP SMB/CIFS direction. |
| `docs/windows-port/security-checklist.md` | Updated | Added D024 guardrails for explicit SMB direct host writes. |
| `docs/windows-port/future-work.md` | Updated | Moved SMB/CIFS direct mounts into accepted follow-up work with constraints. |
| `PLAN.md` | Updated | Avoided duplicate future decision work now that D024 exists. |
| `STATE.md` | Updated | Recorded Slice 1 status and docs-only validation scope. |
| `crates/lsb-proto/src/lib.rs` | Updated | Added `CAP_CIFS_MOUNT`, `MountRequest::Smb`, redacted formatting, and protocol tests. |
| `crates/lsb-guest/src/main.rs` | Updated | Advertises `cifs_mount`, builds sanitized CIFS options, and invokes `mount.cifs` with `PASSWD_FD`. |
| `kernel/lsb_defconfig` | Updated | Enabled built-in CIFS client support. |
| `kernel/lsb_x86_64_defconfig` | Updated | Enabled built-in CIFS client support. |
| `xtask/src/rootfs.rs` | Updated | Installs `cifs-utils`, checks for `mount.cifs`, and tests generated rootfs scripts. |
| `crates/lsb-vm/src/sandbox.rs` | Updated | Minimal exhaustiveness handling for `MountRequest::Smb` so the workspace compiles; no SMB lifecycle/startup implementation. |
| `crates/lsb-proxy/src/config.rs` | Updated | Added `ProxyMode`, mount-only SMB config helpers, gateway/SMB constants, and policy tests. |
| `crates/lsb-proxy/src/dns.rs` | Updated | Mount-only SMB mode answers `host.lsb.internal` locally and refuses arbitrary DNS without host resolver forwarding. |
| `crates/lsb-proxy/src/proxy.rs` | Updated | Routes only guest `10.0.0.1:445` to host `127.0.0.1:445` in SMB modes and denies other mount-only TCP flows. |
| `crates/lsb-cli/src/vm.rs` | Updated | Detects Windows direct mounts and selects mount-only SMB proxy config when `allow_net` is false, or merges SMB relay into the normal proxy when `allow_net` is true; CLI `:ro` remains overlay. |
| `crates/lsb-sdk/src/runtime.rs` | Updated | Mirrors CLI proxy selection for SDK/Node callers without changing `SandboxConfig` or mount API shape. |
| `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/qemu/argv.rs` | Updated | Extended stream-network argv assertions to exclude `-nic`, QEMU user networking, `hostfwd`, TAP, bridge, and NAT tokens. |
| `crates/lsb-platform/Cargo.toml` | Updated | Added Windows API feature gates required by native SMB admin, user, share, and ACL adapters. |
| `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/fs/mod.rs` | Updated | Exposes the Windows SMB lifecycle module under the Windows fs namespace. |
| `crates/lsb-platform/src/windows_x86_64/fs/smb/` | Added | Implements fakeable SMB admin/password/user/ACL/share components, native Windows adapters, lifecycle setup/cleanup, mount request generation, name validation, password redaction, and unit tests. |

## Notes

- Keep this file current during implementation.
- Link back to `PLAN.md` for design details.
- Record deviations from `PLAN.md` in "Follow-Up Decisions Needed" before
  implementing them.
