# Windows SMB Direct Mounts Implementation State

This file is for implementation agents to keep progress, decisions, blockers,
and validation results synchronized while implementing `PLAN.md`.

## Current Status

- Overall status: Slice 7 implementation complete locally; self-hosted Windows
  smoke found readiness, SMB mount-preflight, CIFS UTF-8 kernel config, and SMB
  loopback server-name gaps, fixed in working tree; rerun pending
- Current owner: Codex
- Current branch: codex/lsb-direct-mnt
- Last updated: 2026-07-07
- Latest validated commit: working tree Slice 7 edits on codex/lsb-direct-mnt

## Active Focus

- Current task: Slice 7 Windows smoke tests, recovery, redaction scans, and
  docs finalization
- Relevant files: Windows smoke scripts, Node smoke script, Windows SMB
  lifecycle/recovery, Sandbox SMB cleanup wiring, docs, `STATE.md`
- Immediate next step: Amend/commit the smoke-discovered fixes, then rerun
  `./scripts/win-gh-test smoke`.
- Blockers: Self-hosted Windows helper requires a clean committed working tree.

## Maintainer Decisions

- [x] Use SMB/CIFS for Windows direct directory mounts.
- [x] Preserve macOS-like direct semantics, including `:rw`.
- [x] Require Administrator for Windows SMB direct mounts.
- [x] Use the LocalSandbox controlled proxy path.
- [x] Do not use QEMU user networking, `hostfwd`, TAP, bridge, NAT, or public
  listener paths.
- [x] Create ephemeral Windows SMB shares.
- [x] Create ephemeral Windows users and generated SMB credentials.
- [x] Recursive validation for direct mounts is required.
- [x] Keep CLI `:ro` as overlay.
- [x] Do not enable SMB encryption by default.
- [x] Use one ephemeral Windows user per sandbox.
- [x] Update both kernel configs.

## Progress Checklist

- [x] Update Windows decision docs to supersede the old no-direct-rw decision.
- [x] Enable CIFS client support in both kernel configs.
- [x] Add `cifs-utils` to the rootfs package list.
- [x] Add `MountRequest::Smb`.
- [x] Add `cifs_mount` guest capability.
- [x] Add protocol redaction tests for SMB credentials.

- [x] Add SDK detection/startup for mount-only SMB proxy.
- [x] Preserve Node API shape and direct flag mapping.
- [x] Add Windows direct SMB mount planning.
- [x] Add recursive direct path validation.
